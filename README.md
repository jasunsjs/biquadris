# Biquadris

This is the UWaterloo CS246 (Object-Oriented Programming) final project, Biquadris, which is a model of the classic Tetris game with some variations and new features:
- 2-player competition
- multiple levels of varying difficulty (different block selection probabilities)
- special actions that can be triggered to negatively affect opponent

The project is programmed entirely in C++. Use the provided Makefile to build and compile into an executable to run. 

Received a perfect overall mark (100/100).

Refer to the [UML](uml-final.pdf) diagram to see the OOP structure and design patterns.
